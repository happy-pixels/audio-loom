# Audio Loom

Audio Loom is a framework-agnostic audio management library that provides a centralized system for organizing, playing, and controlling audio assets in both games and user interfaces. It works seamlessly across diverse JavaScript libraries and frameworks—such as Phaser, Three.js, React, Angular, and others—allowing developers to manage audio consistently in a single place, regardless of the underlying technology stack.

## Features

Audio Loom provides a clean and flexible audio management solution with the following capabilities:

- **Audio Grouping by Category**: Organize sounds into logical groups such as SFX, ambient sounds, background music, dialog, UI, and more for better structure and control.
- **Per-Group Volume and Mute Controls**: Independently adjust volume levels or toggle mute on/off for each audio category, making it easy to implement options menus or dynamic audio mixing.
- **Sound Variation**: Assign multiple audio files to a single key and play them randomly to add natural variety to repeated sound effects, such as footsteps, impacts, or gunshots.
- **Playback Modes**: Play sounds as one-shots or start continuous looping playback for a single sound.
- **Shuffled Playlist Looping**: When looping a key with multiple assigned sounds, the library shuffles the sounds and plays them one after another, reshuffling the list once all sounds have played. This creates endless natural variation, perfect for ambient environments or background music tracks.
- **Simple Playback API**: Load, play, stop, and manage sounds with a unified and straightforward interface that integrates easily into any JavaScript project.
